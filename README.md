Advent of Code is a yearly advent calendar containing programming puzzles each day during December. This is my solution to the second part of the day 11 puzzle of year 2022. 

# Project 2
Lakes and wetlands data analysis

[tommihet.github.io/lakes](https://tommihet.github.io/lakesandwetlands.html)

The data for this project is downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/global-lakes-and-wetlands-database/ , originally released to https://gis.openforestdata.pl/layers/glwd_3:geonode:glwd_3 .
The dataset contains information on over 3000 lakes and reservoirs. In this analysis, I explore the dataset and perform cluster analysis.
