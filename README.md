Advent of Code is a yearly advent calendar containing programming puzzles each day during December. This is my solution to the second part of the day 11 puzzle of year 2022. 

# Lakes and wetlands data analysis

[tommihet.github.io/lakes](https://tommihet.github.io/lakesandwetlands.html)

The data for this project is downloaded from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/global-lakes-and-wetlands-database/](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/global-lakes-and-wetlands-database/),
originally released to [https://gis.openforestdata.pl/layers/glwd_3:geonode:glwd_3](https://gis.openforestdata.pl/layers/glwd_3:geonode:glwd_3).
The dataset contains information on over 3000 lakes and reservoirs. In this analysis, I explore the dataset and perform cluster analysis.

# Group project

During spring 2024, I attended BearIT:s ICT Camp, where I was a part of a project group. Our group project was to build a website themed as an oldschool flashgame website. My role was in coding a functional
example game for the site. The game is a interactive representation of the Prisoner's dilemma, where two individual operators are given the opportunity to cooperate or defect. The game was coded in Javascript
and the page is constructed using html and css styling.
